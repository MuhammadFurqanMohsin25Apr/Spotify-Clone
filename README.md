# Spotify-Clone
It is a basic front-end clone of the Spotify web interface, built with HTML and CSS. It features a sidebar navigation, a top navigation bar, and sections displaying trending songs, popular artists, and charts. The layout uses Flexbox for responsive alignment and custom styling to match Spotifyâ€™s dark theme.
